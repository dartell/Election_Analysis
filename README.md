### Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.

	This script could be used to show the counties with the least amount of votes.  For example, modifying the display to show low voter participation can inform candidates on where to focus their marketing campaigns.  Another potential modification includes showing historical data from previous elections.  The election committe can run the script to apply another form of an audit and address any discrepancies it might find.
